Neural Networks
- How do we understand any image or any text? Our brain, understands based on knowledge we have built into it. We understand meaning of words. We understand name of things in vision, we understand their meaning in words. We don't know what exactly, but we do understand the meaning. What we don't understand, we can't replicate or improve or customize.
- Pattern extracting machines. Patterns based on understanding the data
- Building understanding machines or "knowledge extracting & storing" machines from data


Words
- Words are window to knowledge worlds, medium of knowledge. Depending on the topic, we have access to that entire world. Physics, Nuclear Physics, Chemistry
- Words are windows to thought process also. Physics book, on Newton. You can not only understand laws, but you can also understand how Newton thought. If you can learn that, you can apply that thought process and build new knowledge. You can learn from someone great like newton 300 years ago, or 3000 years ago. 
- If you can understand words, you have infinite power. 

How do we understand words? Pay attention to word run & its various permutations. 
- He runs
- I ran
- Run
- RUN
- Lets run
- I am running

We don't know how we understand or our internal understanding of words. 
If we want to do it artifically, same meaning wise representation of word, its called **embedding**.
Most breakthroughs come from using transfer learning. Where we use existing **embeddings**.
