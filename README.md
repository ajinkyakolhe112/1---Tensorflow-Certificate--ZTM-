# GOAL: Tensorflow Developer Certificate

- **Curriculum:** 3 Domains -> Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing & Time Series Data
- **Plan:**
    - Study from ZTM Tensorflow course, in 7 Weeks for 3 domains, 2 weeks per domain
    - Kaggle Medals(Bronze), one for each domain - CV, NLP & Time Series

|            | Progress       |

### Don't take Exam Shortcuts
1. Don't rely on preparing from question bank or remembering code 
2. Questions are based on ability to solve domain problems with tensorflow. If you can solve 4 domain problems, you can answer any question.
3. **Certification is just a measure of your knowledge of Tensorflow. Knowledge is valuable, not Certification.**
4. Practice solving different problems using standardized reusable code. You will build a complete cookbook.
