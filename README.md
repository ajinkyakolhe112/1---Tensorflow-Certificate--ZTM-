# GOAL: Tensorflow Developer Certificate in 7 Weeks
- **Why Tensorflow**
  - Pytorch is better than Tensorflow, but doesn't have certification. Tensorflow does.
  - Tensorflow Certification is good for resume or skill proof
    - After Keras 3.0, you would be able to use Pytorch code for Jax or Tensorflow backend for speedup
  - For a beginner, Pytorch is better. Just Pytorch would be enough
    - For a GrandMaster, Pytorch, Tensorflow, Jax or even C. You see beyond library
  - If I am committing to Tensorflow, commit to Tensorflow. Don't be fboy with Pytorch when learning Tensorflow 
- **Curriculum:** 3 Domains -> Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing & Time Series Data
- **Plan:**
    - Study from ZTM Tensorflow course, in 7 Weeks for 3 domains, 2 weeks per domain
    - Kaggle Medals(Bronze), one for each domain - CV, NLP & Time Series

### Don't take Exam Shortcuts
1. Don't rely on preparing from question bank or remembering code 
2. Questions are based on ability to solve domain problems with tensorflow. If you can solve 4 domain problems, you can answer any question.
3. **Certification is just a measure of your knowledge of Tensorflow. Knowledge is valuable, not Certification.**
4. Practice solving different problems using standardized reusable code. You will build a complete cookbook.
